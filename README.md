## ✨ About This Repo

This repository contains my personal notes, summaries, and practice files while I complete the  
🎓 **Google IT Automation with Python Specialization** on Coursera.

All notes here are written in my own words to help me:
- Understand the lessons better  
- Learn at my own pace  
- Build a simple documentation habit  
- Create something I can look back on anytime

I’m documenting everything here in a simple, honest way so I can track my progress and improve as I go.
