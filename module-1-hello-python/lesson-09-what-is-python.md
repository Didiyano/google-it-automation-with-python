## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 09 Getting Started with Python

## 🌟 Why You’re Learning Python

Python is used in this course because it’s easy to read and easy to write.
Even if you’ve never coded before, Python looks a lot like normal language.
That’s why beginners can understand it quickly.

## 👀 A First Look at Python Code

Here’s the example shown in the lesson:

friends = ["Adam", "Bella", "Chris"]
for name in friends:
    print("Hi " + name)


You can guess what it does just by looking at it.
There’s a list of names, and the program says “Hi” to each of them.
That’s how friendly Python is.

## 💻 Practicing Python

Throughout the course, you’ll run small pieces of code directly in your browser.
Later, you’ll work on bigger exercises as you get more comfortable.
If you don’t have Python installed yet, it’s totally fine.
You can practice using online Python interpreters.

## 🧩 What a Python Interpreter Does

Think of your code like a recipe.
The Python interpreter is the tool that reads the recipe and makes the computer follow each step.
If you write:

print("Hello!")


The interpreter reads it and shows the result instantly.

## 🌐 No Installation Needed Yet

You’ll learn how to install Python later in the course.
For now, you can try everything using the browser or an online interpreter.
It’s a simple way to start without setting up anything.
