## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 21 Using JupyterLab & Jupyter Notebooks

## 🌟 Why Jupyter Matters

As you explore more Python tools, you’ll notice that some environments are better for testing, some for projects, and some for learning.

JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks are special because they let you:
- Write Python code
- Run it instantly
- See the output immediately
- Add notes, text, and explanations
- Combine code + results in one clean document

They are perfect for learning, experimenting, and even sharing your work.

## 🧪 What Is JupyterLab?

JupyterLab is a web-based environment where you can:
- Create Jupyter Notebooks
- Write and run Python code
- Debug step-by-step
- Manage files and folders
- Run your work in the cloud

Think of JupyterLab as your “workspace” — the main interface for working with notebooks online.

## 📒 What Is a Jupyter Notebook?

A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive document where you can mix:
- Live Python code
- Output (like text, tables, charts)
- Markdown notes
- Images
- Explanations

It’s great for:
- Learning Python
- Experiments
- Data cleaning
- Small projects
- Documentation

Everything stays together in one place — you type code, run it, and the result appears right below it.

## ☁️ Using Jupyter Notebook on JupyterLab (Cloud)

To use Jupyter Notebooks online:
- Open the JupyterLab link provided by the course.
- Click + to open a new tab.
- Under Notebook, choose Python.
- A brand new Notebook will open.
- Start typing and running code instantly.

This is the easiest way to practice — no installation needed.

## 💻 Installing Jupyter on Your Computer

If you want to use Jupyter locally, install it using pip.

### 🟦 Install JupyterLab

1.  **Install JupyterLab**  pip install jupyterlab
2.  **Launch it**  jupyter-lab

### 🟨 Install Classic Jupyter Notebook

1. **Install the classic Jupyter Notebook**  pip install notebook
2. **Launch it**  jupyter notebook

Both tools will open in your web browser.

## 📤 Sharing Your Notebooks

One of the best things about Jupyter:
You can easily share your work!

You can share notebooks using:
- Email
- GitHub
- [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.org/)

This makes Jupyter a great tool for collaboration and teaching.
