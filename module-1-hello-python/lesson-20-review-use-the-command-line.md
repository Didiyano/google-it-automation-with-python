## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 20 Review: Using the Command Line

## 🌟 What the Command Line Is For

The command-line lets you tell your computer exactly what to do.

You can:
- move files
- open folders
- access servers
- write and run scripts

In this lesson, you learn how to run Python from the command line and how to use IDLE, the Python GUI editor.

## 🍎 Using the Command Line on macOS

Open Spotlight and search for Terminal.
When Terminal opens, you’ll see your username followed by a $ symbol.

macOS comes with Python 2.7 already installed, but you can install Python 3 from python.org.

**To check your version:**

python --version


**To check Python 3:**

python3 --version


Because macOS can have both Python 2 and Python 3, you must pay attention to which one you’re using.

## 🪟 Using the Command Line on Windows

Open the Start menu and search for cmd.
Right-click it and choose Run as administrator.

Windows does not come with Python installed.
Download it from the official Python website.

When installing:

- Choose the correct installer (64-bit or 32-bit)
- Select Install launcher for all users
- Check Add python.exe to PATH

After installation, **check your version**:

python --version


If Python was installed correctly, you’ll see the version number.

## 🐧 Using the Command Line on Linux

Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open the terminal.

Most Linux systems already have Python installed.

Try:
python


If that doesn’t work, install Python 3 with:
sudo apt install python3


To start the interactive Python mode:
python


You can also use IDLE on Linux by installing it through your package manager.

## 🖥️ Using IDLE

IDLE comes with Python on Windows and macOS.
Linux users can install it manually.

IDLE is a simple tool that lets you:

- write Python code
- run Python scripts
- use syntax highlighting
- use auto-indentation
- test your code quickly

When you open IDLE, you’ll see a blank Python shell.
You can start writing code immediately.

To write a script:
- Go to File → New File
- Type your Python code
- Save it with File → Save As
- Run it using Run → Run Module

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- You can run Python from the command line on any operating system.
- IDLE is a good beginner tool for writing and running Python scripts.
- The command line + IDLE makes it easy to test and debug .py files.
