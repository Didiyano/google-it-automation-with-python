## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 22 Hands-On: Using JupyterLab & Jupyter Notebooks

## 🌟 Why This Lesson Matters

In the previous lesson, you learned what JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks are.

Now, you’ll learn how to actually use them:
- How to open JupyterLab
- How to create a new notebook
- How to write and run code
- How to save and download your notebook
- How to install Jupyter locally

These skills are essential if you want to experiment with Python, analyze data, or build scripts interactively.

## ☁️ Using JupyterLab in the Cloud

The easiest way to start is online through:

🌐 [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/)

Steps to launch JupyterLab:
- Go to the Jupyter website
- Click Try
- Select JupyterLab
- JupyterLab opens in your browser
- Click the + button to open a new tab
- Under Notebook, choose Python
- A new notebook will open, ready for you to write Python code.

## 🧪 Writing Your First Code Cell

Inside the notebook, you’ll see a cell with a blue border.
This is where you type your Python code.

Example:

print("Hello world")


To run the code:

Click the Run button in the toolbar

Your output will appear directly under the cell.
This makes it easy to understand how your code works, step by step.

## 💾 Saving & Downloading Your Notebook

**To save your notebook:**

Click the Save icon in the top toolbar

Name your file (for example: Hello.ipynb)

**To download it:**

Go to File → Download

This lets you keep a copy or share it with others.

## 💻 Installing Jupyter Locally

If you want to work offline or prefer having it installed on your computer, you can install Jupyter using pip.

### 🟦 Install JupyterLab

1.  pip install jupyterlab
2.  Launch it:

jupyter-lab

### 🟨 Install Classic Jupyter Notebook

1.  pip install notebook
2.  Launch it:

jupyter notebook


Both will open automatically in your browser.

## 📤 Sharing Your Notebooks

One of the biggest advantages of Jupyter Notebooks is how easy they are to share.

You can send them via:
- Email
- GitHub
- [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.org/)

This makes notebooks perfect for collaboration, teaching, and documentation.
