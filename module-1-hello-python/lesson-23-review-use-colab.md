## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 23 Using Google Colab

## 🌟 Why Colab Matters

Google Colab (short for Colaboratory) is one of the fastest and easiest ways to run Python code — no installation, no setup, no configuration.

Colab gives you:
- A Jupyter Notebook environment
- Hosted on Google’s servers
- Connected to your Google Drive
- Ready to use instantly

It’s perfect for learning, experimenting, and sharing Python notebooks.
