## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 17 Using Python as a Calculator

## 🌟 Python Can Do Math Too

Python isn’t just for automation or scripting — it can also work like a calculator.
Before getting into harder topics, this lesson shows you how Python handles basic math.

Here are some simple examples:

4 + 5 → 9
9 * 7 → 63
-1 / 4 → -0.25

Easy, right?

## 🔁 Repeating Numbers

Some numbers repeat forever, like 1/3.
Python can’t display infinite digits, so it shows a long decimal version instead.

Example:

1 / 3 → 0.3333333333333333

---

## 🧮 Longer Math Expressions
You can also write full math expressions inside Python.

Example:
Divide 2050 by 5, subtract 32, then divide the result by 9.

Just like normal math, you use parentheses to control the order.

---

## 📈 Powers (Exponents)
If you want squares, cubes, or any number to a power, Python uses **.

Example:
2 to the power of 10 → 2 ** 10

Python will return the answer instantly.

## 😄 Don’t Worry — This Isn’t an Algebra Class

You’re not expected to do advanced math here.
The goal is simply to help you get familiar with Python’s mathematical abilities.

## ❓ Why Use Python Instead of a Calculator?

Great question.
In IT jobs, you’ll often need quick calculations like:

- Counting how many times a word appears
- Finding the average time an operation takes
- Figuring out how much to compress an image
- Performing repeated or large calculations

A script can do these tasks faster, more accurately, and without you repeating the same steps over and over.

## 📊 Python Can Do Even More
Python has powerful libraries for:
- Data analysis
- Statistics
- Machine learning
- Scientific computing

You won’t explore those in this course, but they exist if you ever want to learn more.

## 📝 What’s Next?

You’ll get a cheat sheet to review what you've learned so far.
After that, there’s a quiz with a few small coding exercises.

If anything feels confusing, you can always replay the lesson.
You’re doing great — keep going!
