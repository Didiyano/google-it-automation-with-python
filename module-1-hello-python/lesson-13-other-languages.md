## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 13 Different Programming Languages

## 🌟 Python Is Just One Tool

Even though this course uses Python, it’s only one of many programming languages.
Each language is like a tool in your IT toolbox, and every tool has strengths and weaknesses.

Some languages are faster.
Some are better for big enterprise systems.
Others are great at handling numbers or automation.

## 🖥️ Platform-Specific Languages

Some scripting languages are made for one operating system:
- PowerShell for Windows
- Bash for Linux
- System administrators use these every day to automate tasks on their systems.

---

## 🧰 Other General-Purpose Scripting Languages

Besides Python, there are languages like:
- Perl
- Ruby
- JavaScript

JavaScript started as a language for websites, but now it’s also used on servers and many other places.

## ⚙️ Traditional Programming Languages

You’ll also hear about older or more structured languages such as:
- C
- C++
- Java
- Go

As you grow in your IT career, you’ll likely meet several of these languages and learn when to use each one.

## 📘 Why Learning Python Helps You Learn Others

The good news is this:
Once you understand the basics of programming in Python, it becomes easier to learn other languages.

All languages need to do similar things:
- Create variables
- Control program flow
- Read input
- Show output

They do these tasks in different ways, but the core ideas are the same.
That’s why learning your first programming language is the hardest — after that, everything becomes easier.

## 🌍 Programming Languages Are Like Spoken Languages

Just like learning a foreign language, you need to understand the syntax and meaning of each programming language.
But unlike human languages, programming languages share many similarities.
This makes picking up a second programming language much simpler.

## 💡 A Simple Example: Printing “Hello, World” 10 Times

The lesson compares Python, Bash, and PowerShell:
- Python uses print and range(10)
- Bash uses echo and a sequence from 1 to 10
- PowerShell uses Write-Host and counts from 1 to 10

The commands look different, but the goal is the same:
Show text on the screen and count to 10.

## 🎯 What You Should Focus On

There are many languages out there, but don’t worry about them right now.
For this course, you only need to learn Python.
Once you understand Python, you can explore any other language you want later.
