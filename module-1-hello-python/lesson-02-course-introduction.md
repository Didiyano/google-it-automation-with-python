## 💡 Why Programming Matters in IT

Programming is one of the most valuable skills you can develop in IT.

It helps you:
- automate repetitive tasks
- work more efficiently
- avoid manual errors
- handle large workloads with less effort

Instead of doing everything by hand, you can write a script once and let the computer handle the rest.

This skill can open the door to roles such as:
- Systems Administrator
- Cloud Solutions Engineer
- DevOps Specialist
- Site Reliability Engineer
- Web Developer or Data Analyst

More and more employers are looking for candidates who can automate tasks and think in terms of problem-solving.

## 🌱 Starting Small (and Why That’s Okay)

Christine compares learning Python to learning a new language or any other new skill:
- start with the basics
- practice often
- grow gradually.

Whether it’s French, knitting, skateboarding, or Python:
you learn through repetition and curiosity, not perfection.

This course is built to help you:
- learn the fundamentals
- practice consistently
- grow confidence with each step

You don’t need to know everything on day one.
