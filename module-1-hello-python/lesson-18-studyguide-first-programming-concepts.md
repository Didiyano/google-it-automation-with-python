## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 18 Study Guide: First Programming Concepts

## 🌟 What This Study Guide Is For

This guide gives you a quick summary of everything you learned in this section.
It also helps you prepare for the upcoming practice quiz.

## 🧩 Functions

A function is a small piece of code that performs a specific job.

So far, the main function you’ve used is:

print("Hello world!")

The print() function shows text on the screen.
You’ll use it a lot to check if your code is working.

Later in the course, you’ll learn how to create your own functions.

## 🔑 Keywords

Keywords are special reserved words in Python.
They have specific meanings and you can’t use them as variable names.

In your early examples, you saw:

- for
- in

You’ll learn many more keywords soon, including:

- Values: True, False, None
- Conditions: if, elif, else
- Logical operators: and, or, not
- Loops: for, in, while, break, continue
- Functions: def, return

Don’t worry about memorizing them all now.
You will learn each one step by step as you use them.

## ➕ Arithmetic Operators

Python can do basic math and more.
Here are the operators you’ll see often:

- x + y → addition
- x - y → subtraction
- x * y → multiplication
- x / y → division
- x ** y → exponent (x to the power of y)
- x ** 2 → square
- x ** 3 → cube
- x ** (1/2) → square root
- x // y → floor division (whole number result)
- x % y → modulo (remainder)

---

## 🧮 Order of Operations

Python follows the normal math order.
From highest priority to lowest:

- Parentheses: ( ), [ ], { }
- Exponents: x ** y
- Multiplication and Division: * and /
- Addition and Subtraction: + and -

A common way to remember this is PEMDAS.
