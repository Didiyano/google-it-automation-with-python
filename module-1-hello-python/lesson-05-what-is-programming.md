## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 05 What Is a Program?

---

## 🌟 Understanding the Idea of a Program

- A program is like a recipe that tells your computer exactly what to do.
- When you write a program, you’re listing step-by-step instructions.
- The computer reads your instructions and follows them exactly as written.

---

## 📚 Programming Languages

- These “recipes” are written in programming languages.
- They work similarly to spoken languages because they have structure and meaning.
- The rules are called syntax, and the meaning behind them is semantics.

---

## ✏️ Syntax vs Semantics (Simple Version)

- Syntax is how you write the instruction.
- Semantics is what the instruction actually does.
- Just like building a proper sentence in English, code must follow rules to make sense.

## 🌈 Many Languages, Same Foundations

- There are lots of programming languages, each with its own purpose.
- But the basic concepts are similar across all of them.
- Once you learn one language well, picking up another becomes much easier.

## 🖥️ Computers Do Exactly What You Tell Them

- A computer doesn’t guess or assume anything.
- It does exactly what you write — no more, no less.
- That’s why clear instructions and correct syntax matter so much.

## 📝 Script vs Program

- The difference between the two isn’t strict.
- In this course, both terms are used the same way.
- A script is simply a small, quick program that’s easy to write and run.

## 🔮 What’s Coming Next

- You’ll start learning Python as a scripting language.
- The course will guide you through Python syntax and how each instruction works.
- Before writing your first script, the next lesson explains what automation is and why it’s useful.
