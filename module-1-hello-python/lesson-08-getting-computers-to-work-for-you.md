## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 07 When Should You Automate?

## 🌟 Understanding Why Automation Helps

- Many tasks in IT repeat every day, like creating accounts, installing software, backing up data, or authenticating systems.
- If a task happens often and doesn’t change much, it’s a strong candidate for automation.
- Automation reduces mistakes and saves time because the computer follows instructions exactly.

## 💬 A Real IT Example

- The instructor shared a story from her first IT job.
- She used to type the same three commands every morning to authenticate into systems.
- She wrote a script to run them automatically so she wouldn’t have to type them daily.
- The monitoring team noticed unusual activity and asked her to remove it — but the idea still shows how helpful automation can be.

## 📧 A Simple Newsletter Scenario

- Imagine collecting a big list of emails from a conference.
- Some people are already subscribed, some are new.
- Manually checking every email would be slow, boring, and full of possible mistakes.
- A program could check duplicates, add only new emails, and handle the whole process consistently.

## 📨 Smarter Email Sending

- If you manually send newsletters, you’d have to send the same email to everyone.
- Personalizing messages would take too much time.
- With automation, each email can automatically include the person’s name or company.
- You save hours of work and still send something more effective.

## 🧠 Why Automation Matters

- Automation lets you focus on tasks that require thinking, not repetitive steps.
- Computers handle the boring parts without getting tired or distracted.
- Once you write a program, you can use it again anytime you need it.

## 🤓 The Coolest Automation Example

- The instructor also shared a favorite project she worked on at Google.
- She wrote a script that scanned a huge directory tree, checked file contents, and updated access permissions across many services.
- It saved tons of manual effort and showed how powerful automation can be.
