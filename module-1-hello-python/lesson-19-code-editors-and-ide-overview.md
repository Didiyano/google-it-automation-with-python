## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 19 Introduction to Coding Tools: Code Editors & IDEs

## 🌟 Why Coding Tools Matter

Now that you’ve learned some Python basics, it’s time to explore the tools that help you write code more easily.
Coding tools make programming faster, clearer, and more organized.

## ✏️ What Is a Code Editor?

A code editor is a tool that helps you write and understand code.

It usually includes features like:
- Syntax highlighting (colors for keywords and symbols)
- Automatic indentation
- Error checking
- Auto-completion

All these features make writing code smoother and help you avoid mistakes.

Examples you’ll see in this course include:

- VS Code
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Google Colab

These tools let you write, debug, and run Python code.

## 🧠 What Is an IDE?

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) has everything a code editor has — and more.

A helpful way to understand the difference:

A code editor is like a landline phone.
It can do the basics: dial numbers and make calls.

An IDE is like a smartphone.
It still does phone calls, but also lets you video call, browse the internet, send messages, and use apps.

An IDE includes:

- A code editor
- Tools for building and testing programs
- Debugging tools
- Project management features
- Packaging tools

Basically, an IDE puts everything you need for coding into one place.

## 🐍 Meet IDLE — Your First IDE

IDLE is the simple IDE that comes bundled with Python.

It’s designed for beginners:

- Easy to use
- Good for practicing Python
- Great for small programs
- Not ideal for big projects

But it’s perfect for learning how IDEs work.
