## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 15 Your First Python Program: Hello, World

## 🌟 Writing Your First Line of Python

Now that you’ve seen what Python code looks like, it’s time to try one of the most classic examples:
making your computer say “Hello, World.”

You can run this using your local Python interpreter or any online interpreter.

When you run:

print("Hello, World")

you’ll see the message appear on the screen.
It might feel like magic, but it’s simply Python doing exactly what you told it to do.

## 🖨️ Why It Works

The word print is a Python function.
Functions are small pieces of code that perform a specific task.
In this case, the task is: show this text on the screen.

Python comes with many built-in functions like this, and you’ll learn to write your own later in the course.

## 🔑 What Are Keywords?

Python also has keywords, which are special reserved words used to build instructions.

Examples include:
- if
- while
- for

You can’t use these words as variable names because Python uses them for specific purposes.

Both functions and keywords make up the syntax of the Python language.

## 📝 What’s Inside the Quotes?

Notice that "Hello, World" is wrapped in double quotes.
Anything inside quotes is treated as a string—which simply means text.

Text inside quotes is content for your program.
Text outside quotes is code.

## 📚 A Fun Bit of History

“Hello, World” has been the traditional first program for new programmers since the 1970s.
It first appeared in a famous book called The C Programming Language.

In Python, the example is just one line.
In C, the same thing takes three lines.
Some languages take even more.

The purpose isn’t to teach you everything—it's to help you see what a basic program looks like and how a function is used.
