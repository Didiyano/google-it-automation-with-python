## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 10 Python Resources

## 🌟 Using Python on Your Own

The best way to improve in Python is to practice by yourself.
If you already have Python installed, you can open it by typing python3 in your terminal
(or just python if you’re using Windows).
To close it, type exit() or press Ctrl + D.

If you don’t have Python installed yet, don’t worry.
A later course will show you exactly how to set it up.

## 💻 Where You Can Practice Online

You can still start practicing right now using online Python interpreters.
An interpreter is more interactive, while a codepad is simpler, but both let you run Python and see the output immediately.

Here are some popular places you can try:

https://www.python.org/shell/

https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_interpreter

https://repl.it/languages/python3

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python3_online.php

https://rextester.com/l/python3_online_compiler

https://trinket.io/python3

Try a few of them and see which one feels the most comfortable for you.

## 📜 Python’s History and Current Status

Python was released almost 30 years ago, and it has grown a lot.
You can read more about its history on the “History of Python” Wikipedia page or in the history section of the official docs.

Python keeps improving, with new versions released often.
Updates can introduce new features, fix security issues, and make the language faster.
Sometimes code needs small changes when upgrading, but Python provides tools to help with that.

For this course, you’ll be using Python 3.7.
