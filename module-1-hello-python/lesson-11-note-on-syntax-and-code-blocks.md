## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 11 A Note on Syntax and Code Blocks

## 🌟 Why Syntax Matters

When writing Python, the smallest mistake can stop your code from running.
A missing bracket, an extra comma, or even the wrong type of quote can cause a syntax error.
If your code doesn’t run at all, it usually means something is written incorrectly.

Small mistakes can be hard to find, especially in long code, so paying attention to syntax early on will save you a lot of time.

## 🐞 Common Syntax Errors

These are mistakes that stop your code before it even starts:

- Misspelled words
- Incorrect indentation
- Missing or wrong brackets
- Wrong types of quotes
- Missing colons after certain lines
- Using the wrong data type
- Misusing Python reserved words
- Using the wrong uppercase or lowercase letters
- Python is case-sensitive, so Name and name are not the same.

Even one character typed incorrectly can break the entire program.

## 🧠 What About Semantic Errors?

Sometimes your code runs, but the result is not what you expected.
This means the syntax is correct, but the logic is wrong.

Think of it like writing a sentence with perfect grammar, but the meaning is not what you intended.

Common semantic problems include:

- The code works, but the output is not what you want
- Logic that doesn’t match the goal of the program

So syntax = how you write it
Semantics = what the code actually means

## ✅ Check Your Code Carefully

When doing the exercises in this course, always look for both syntax and semantic issues.
Fixing one error doesn’t guarantee the program will do the right thing.

After making any changes, remember to click Run to test your code again.
