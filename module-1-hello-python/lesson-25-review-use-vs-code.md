## 🐍 Module 1 – Lesson 25 Using VS Code

## 🌟 Why VS Code Matters

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is one of the most popular code editors in the world.
It’s more powerful than Jupyter Notebook and Colab because it includes:

- IntelliSense (smart code completion)
- An interactive debugger
- Built-in terminal
- Syntax highlighting
- Tools for building and managing full projects

Even with all these features, VS Code stays simple, fast, and beginner-friendly, making it a great choice for writing Python code.

## 💻 Using VS Code for Python

Before you can code in Python using VS Code, you need:

- Python 3 installed
- VS Code installed
- VS Code Python extension installed

Let’s go through these one by one.

---

✔️ Check if Python 3 Is Installed

Open your terminal (Linux/macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type:

**Linux / macOS**
python3 --version

**Windows**
py -3 --version

✅ If Python is installed, you’ll see something like:
Python 3.11.3

❌ If it’s not installed, you’ll see:
command not found: python


If Python isn’t installed, download it from the official Python website before continuing.

## 📥 Download VS Code & Install Python Extension

1. Download VS Code

VS Code works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Download it from the official VS Code website, then follow the installation steps.

2. Install the Python Extension

Visit the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and install the Python extension.

After installation, you’ll see the Python icon in VS Code’s sidebar.

⚠️ **Note (macOS)**
You cannot install the Python extension directly from the Marketplace app.

You must:

- Press **Cmd + Shift + P**
- Type **shell command**
- Select **Install ‘code’ command in PATH**

After this, the extension will install correctly.

## 🧪 Try VS Code Without Installing (Optional)

There is an [online version of VS Code](https://vscode.dev/) you can try instantly — no installation required.

## 📝 Create Your First Python File

Let’s create and run a basic Python script.

✔️ Step 1: Create a New Python File

In VS Code:

**File → New File → Python File**

A new workspace opens where you can write your code.

✔️ Step 2: Write a Simple Program

Type:

print("Hello World!")

✔️ Step 3: Run the Code

Click the **Run & Debug** icon on the left toolbar.

Then click:

**Run and Debug**

VS Code will prompt you to name and save your file.
Example filename:

helloworld.py

✔️ Step 4: View Output

Once the file runs, you’ll see the output inside the terminal panel:

Hello World!


You’ve officially run your first Python program in VS Code!
